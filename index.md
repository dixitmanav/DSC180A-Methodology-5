**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
The most interesting topic convered in my domain so far is the aspect of dividing up different census tracts into employment centers. The way that Sandag has been able to do so is really interesting, and we get to use their data to replicate this project. \
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** \
Something that I would like to pursue is to see if unsupervised learning can be used to make different employment center boundaries within the San Diego region. \
**3.What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** \
Something I would change is to use their Internal Data portal more efficiently instead of just using python on my own and then trying to figure it out on their portal. \
**4.What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** \
I would love to use unsupervised learning techniques as well as clustering methods to try and create new boundaries for the employment centers.
